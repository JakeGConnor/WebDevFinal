                    from what we started working on. We started in high 
                    school and would spend some weekend nights working 
                    on cutting boards, serving trays, and some coasters. 
                    We had a lot of big ideas, but we didn't have a lot 
                    of free time between sports and extracurriculars.

                <p id="secondP">We got better slowly and made what we could when 
                    we could. Cade was able to get a lot of the tools 
                    that we used from family and they were excited about 
                    it. We had plans to make it to a craft fair and finally 
                    sell some of what we were making. Then Cade got sick 
                    and has not been able to do much since then.

                <p id="thirdP">Covid took out a lot of my ability to even see 
                    Cade for the better part of the first 9 months or 
                    so. We weren't able to do a lot, but now that I was 
                    able to work while attending college I was able to 
                    get some upgrades. Along with helping a neighbor cut 
                    down a beautiful walnut tree, we have material for 
                    projects.

                    peices when we have the chance and inspiration knocks. 
                    With more upgrades we are able to make better peices 
                    more efficiently. As for now we are just going to 
                    make beautiful peices when we can.
